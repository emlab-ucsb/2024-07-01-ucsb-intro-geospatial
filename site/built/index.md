Welcome to the Intro to Geospatial Raster and Vector data workshop for the Minorities in Shark Sciences group! 

We have a fun workshop planned for you all. 

In addition to class time on **Mondays from 3-5p PT**, we will offer an optional "Office Hours" time on **Thursdays from 4-5p PT**. These Office Hours will alternate between troubleshooting sessions where you can bring anything in R that you've been working on and would like some guidance with, and "SharkyR" talks, where shark scientists will come and give a presentation about how they have used R in their work. 

We have the schedule for both below.
