## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the data described [here](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/index.html#data) and save it in a handy location. We will organize our folders during the workshop.

## Software Setup

You can follow the instructions [here](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/index.html#setup) to download R and RStudio
